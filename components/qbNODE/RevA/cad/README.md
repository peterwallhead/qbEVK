# 3D Printing Notes
All tolerances were set for the most accurate print on a specific Flashforge Adventurer 3. Your mileage may vary.

## [end-cap.stl](https://github.com/peterwallhead/qbEVK/blob/master/components/qbNODE/RevA/cad/exports/end-cap.stl)

Designed to be printed with the bolt head countersinks flat against the bed with minimal support material.

Print setting | Value
------------ | -------------
Extruder temperature | 200℃
Bed temperature | 60℃
Material | Flashforge Green PLA (test prints)
Infill | 5%
Supports | Yes
Brim (optional based on printer used) | Yes (5mm margin)
Raft (optional based on printer used) | No

## [corner-piller.stl](https://github.com/peterwallhead/qbEVK/blob/master/components/qbNODE/RevA/cad/exports/corner-pillar.stl)

Can be printed orientated as per the STL file, or rotated so that one side of the qbEDGE PCB cutout sits against the bed.

Print setting | Value
------------ | -------------
Extruder temperature | 200℃
Bed temperature | 60℃
Material | Flashforge Green PLA (test prints)
Infill | 0%
Supports | No (when printed on one side)
Brim | No
Raft | Yes
