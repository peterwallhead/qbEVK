# 3D Printing Notes
All tolerances were set for the most accurate print on a specific Flashforge Adventurer 3. Your mileage may vary.

## [end-cap.stl](https://github.com/peterwallhead/qbEVK/blob/master/components/qbNODE/RevA/cad/exports/end-cap.stl)

Designed to be printed with the PCB slots facing upwards.

Print setting | Value
------------ | -------------
Extruder temperature | 200℃
Bed temperature | 60℃
Material | Flashforge Black PLA (test prints)
Infill | 5%
Supports | Yes
Brim | Optional based on printer used
Raft | Optional based on printer used

## [corner-cover.stl](https://github.com/peterwallhead/qbEVK/blob/master/components/qbNODE/RevA/cad/exports/corner-cover.stl)

Designed to printed with the slightly angled sides facing upwards. This piece is decorative as the PCBs should be held tightly in their slots.

Extruder temperature | 200℃
Bed temperature | 60℃
Material | Flashforge Black PLA (test prints)
Infill | 15%

## [jig-clamp.stl](https://github.com/peterwallhead/qbEVK/blob/master/components/qbNODE/RevA/cad/exports/jig-clamp.stl)

Can be used to help keep a qbNODE in place during development and programming by screwing one of theses pieces down to a bench in each corner.
